(The Admin/Agent Ultimate Guide)

As an Admin and/or Agent for the Clients of SoftwareSeni, you are obliged to respond and reply new tickets that enter the workspace. New tickets should also be assigned to the right agents so that the requests mentioned in the ticket can be taken care of. Below are the steps of responding to new tickets in the FlexiPeople Workspace.

### Replying to New Tickets
* A new ticket when entering the FlexiPeople Workspace will appear in bold letters, and the sender will be colored blue.

  A. Click the <span classe="red">Agent</span> drop-down, and choose the name of the agent that you want to assign the ticket to. For incoming Feedback, assign the tickets to the PMs (Adryn or Gamma). But if the ticket is a quote request or if it is about a bug in the system, send it to the tech department instead. Or if unsure, consult with your SDM and/or the PMs.

  B. Select <span class="red">Department</span> drop-down and choose from where the ticket is from, i.e. Spotzer AU, Spotzer EU, Server Support, etc.
  
  C. The <span class="red">Task Type</span> drop-down and then choose the kind of task the ticket is about.
  
  D. If you know the priority of the ticket, you can click on to the <span class="red">Priority</span> menu and choose its priority number—no. 1 is URGENT & no. 10 is LOW PRIORITY. Otherwise, just leave it be.
  
  E. Now, to set the “Status” of the ticket, click on the drop-down and choose.
  
2. Click the <span class="blue">ADD PROJECT LABEL</span>, and type in the name (usually for Spotzer EU) and/or the abbreviation (mostly for Spotzer AU) of the project.
3. Click the <span class="blue">REPLY</span> button. If the ticket has CCs and BCCs, choose REPLY ALL instead

### Adding a personal note to tickets
After the ticket is replied and assigned to an agent, a personal note may be added. <div class="note">This personal note is for internal use only. Client will not be able to see this. </div>
In order to create a new note, the steps are as follow:

1. First of all, click on the <span class="blue">Add Internal Note</span> option at the bottom right of the ticket, then a form will appear at the top, right under the Add Project Label option.
2. Next, click on the <span class="blue">Add Agents</span> menu and choose the name of the agent—it is usually the agents that the ticket is assigned to, otherwise ask the SDM or the PMs for this.
3. Then, write down the kind of information that you want to inform or convey to the agent(s).
4. After the note is written, click on the <span class="blue">Add Personal Note</span> and a new note will appear.

<div class="note">**Special Note:**
* Once the ticket is replied, the agents will further on reply to the client. Although, at times one agent will sometimes ask the admin/another agent to reply an email on their behalf.
* Please keep in mind that incoming tickets need to be replied AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. This fast response is necessary in order to notify the client whether the ticket is already being handled or not.
* At times you may also need to close some tickets that are available in the Workspace. Usually after the ticket is being resolved, the PM will send an email saying that the ticket is already resolved and will put the status into “Waiting on Spotzer” or “In Production.” If the client replies this and saying their thanks, you can directly close the ticket. If not, then please consult with the SDM or the PMs for further information.
* Every Monday and Friday, coordinate with the PMs about the remaining open tickets. If there are tickets that have been resolved but it is not yet closed, please close it.
* **Always coordinate with the PMs and/or the tech dept. before assigning and closing tickets.**
