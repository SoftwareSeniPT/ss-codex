This is introduction for this guide.

## Introduction

This Codex is a living document that will be updated as we continue to develop the tenets and specifics of SoftwareSeni best practice. The goal is to develop a single underlying system that allows for unified best practice across projects and educate ourselves by learning from the experience. 

SS Codex is an open project for SS, meaning you can directly impact its evolution by filing issues and submitting pull requests. This is as much your tool as it is ours, and we look forward to collaborating with staff and partners on making it even better.

## Principles
1. We learn from the root. Not abstraction. Javascript before jQUery. CSS before Bootstrap. PHP before Wordpress. 
2. We acknowledge that performance is critical. 

## Are you a Freshman?
As a newly joined employee in SoftwareSeni, you will need to perform several tasks. Communication apps, e-mail, project management tools, and many more. Below is a list of things you should do on your first day in SS. 

### Seat

### E-mail
SoftwareSeni uses a very commun e-mail server. The GMail for Business. HR should have assigned that to you already, if not, see with them ASAP. If already, you can always prepare your e-mail signature.

### Communication
We use many types of communication in SoftwareSeni. Depending on what you are working on, it can requests you to install Skype and/or Slack. Skype is usually if you are to do calls with Clients. Slack is mostly for internal only.
1. Skype : Make sure to use myname-softwaresni as your ID. Do not use your personal Skype. You do not want to do that....really.
2. Slack : You can ask your Lead to invite you, or you can always go ahead, and do it yourself. you can look <a href="https://slack.com/downloads" target="_blank">here</a> to download on your platform/OS. And Join our main room #softwareseni.

### Project Management Tools

### Google Drive access (If needed)
