#### Launch 3


**1. Check there is no php code calling the server. If there is then correct it**


**2. Check the error logs on the server for the site. If there are any errors then please fix the code.**

The best way to check this ticket is the next day after developer completed this task. For example, dev done on Wednesday, you should leave the comment to PM stated that “to make sure that there is no error log appear, the best for us to wait up to the next day. I will hold this ticket”. Don’t assign this ticket to PM. Just make sure the next day you check it as priority.

To check on error logs, go to https://webhost.agentpoint.com.au/home and then find client’s account.

If you find the client account, click on “Logs” button.

Once you are inside, there will appear Access Logs and Error Logs. You need to check on the Error Logs section. There are two scenarios here:

If the Error Logs are clear, you can just leave it and close the tickets.

If the Error Logs still appear, please ask the developer whether the logs is only a warning (then we can just leave) or about the bug need developer to fix (then assign the tickets back to developer)

### **B. Understand the workflow in SPOTZER Team**

Since we are creating new website for new clients, so all initial request should come from PM first. 

![2015-11-10_16h14_30](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15763875/11059449/62986a46-87cc-11e5-812a-76fd1cb6a02d.png)

1. PM will assign to BE to setup and content integration. 
2. Once Setup done, PM will assign to FE to style the website.
3. Once the styling done, QA will received full test ticket. Check based on initial request from client. You can check from mockup document (Desktop and Breakpoint). Ask PM for the document.
4. If you find bugs, you need to create the issues on Phabicator and assign to BE/FE. Check again these bugs after BE/FE have already fixed.
5. Do full test if all tickets on Phabicator have already done and need full test again. If all function worked fine, report to PM.
6. After all done, PM will show the demo site to clients, and if client wish to have further adjustments, tickets will be sent to developer / designer that QA need to check later one.
7. This cycle will occur until PM stated that the site is ready to launch.


### **C. Understand The Bug Tracking System**

1. Register to phabicator : http://projects.softwareseni.com/ 
2. After registering, ask your manager to give access to the project.
3. Learn how to create and manage the ticket.
4. For checking your ticket: http://projects.softwareseni.com/maniphest/
 

### **D. Note For Testing Process**

1. Take a look at the Project Docs first and understand what client want.
2. Also check the Mockups design.
3. While testing, do not forget to fill and update the Checklist.
4. If there are something unclear about the project or anything, ask PM or anyone.

### **E. Quality Assurance Role**

Of course the **main task for QA staff is to assure quality standard as requested by client based on tickets and documentation.** 
In other word, QA staff should make sure the works from developers are done exactly as requested by clients to meet the expected delivery date.

On daily basis, some things need to be checked on are:
+ Checking hyperlink in the whole site linked to appropriate pages.
+ Checking for missing content (static text and images)
+ Checking the spelling and grammar of content.
+ Checking the image file size to make sure not too large and not slowing the loading time.
+ Checking for browser compatibility both on desktop and responsive view. 
+ Checking all forms are working correctly and the mandatory warning appear.
+ Checking the vcs calendar to appear correctly on google calendar.
+ Checking the website design appear exactly like the client wants. Always check the overview how the client wish the sites to appear.
+ Maintaining good communication to Developers and Project Managers
+ Give solution to Developers and Project Managers if any requests unable to complete exactly as requested by clients
+ Documenting any new issues with new testing method if any to QA shared document.

### **F. Quality Assurance Checklist**

A checklist is needed to reduce failure by compensating for potential limits of our memory and attention. And also, it helps us to ensure consistency and completeness in carrying out a task.

There are two kinds of Checklist for Spotzer Team, *Demo Site Checklist* and *Live Site Checklist*. 

For the *Demo Site Checklist* you can find it in  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11vwjHA47iRW_mAmsMkhgdffgr8yxMqg1fxajfe85FaY/edit?ts=563031f7#gid=1530176155

And for the *Live Site Checklist* you can find it in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OgQmV-eeDGkPOThUs2uoUySmtPjJRK-xvQTT3egxVk8/edit#gid=831255455

The checklist is still on developing. So, if you think it need some improvement, dont hesitate to tell your supervisor about it.
