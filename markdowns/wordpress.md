## Setting Up

By default, the template contains extra boilerplate structure to account for Woocommerce pages and functionality. Every time a new site is started, make sure you determine whether or not the store/Woocommerce components will be needed. If you won't be needing them (most sites), follow these steps:

## PM Process
### Preparing Collateral Files
*Check the email from your Manager about your new project (ask the Manager if you don’t get it yet)
*Open the Data & Assignment spreadsheet here (ask the manager if you don’t have the access to edit this page.)
*Check if your new project already listed there or not (ask the Manager about the project code name - usually only 3 letters)
*Search for the dropbox link from the mail that sent by your Manager (at step 1)
*Fill the Data & Assignment spreadsheet (on step 2) with the dropbox link that provided from the mail (from step 4)
*Back to the dropbox folder that you get from the mail, download these important 3 files : 
  *Wordpress Brief (usually has a name like : [project name] Wordpress Brief.pdf
  *Sitemap
  *Text assets / document that will be the content of the site
*Open Spotzer share folder on gDrive here (ask the Manager if you don’t have access to edit this share folder).
*Navigate to Spotzer > Projects > YPNZ > then create new project folder here (don’t forget also put project code name at the end of your project name)
*Create folder called “Collateral” inside your project folder.
*Put all the 3 files (from step 6)  that you downloaded from the dropbox above (step 6) to the Collateral folder (from step 9)
*Get the gDrive link of your project that you just created on step 8, then put the gDrive link into the Data & Assignment spreadsheet (on step 2)
